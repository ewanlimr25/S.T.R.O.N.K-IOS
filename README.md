# Store.Track.Remind.Optimize.N.Keep-IOS

As someone who keeps track of his caloric intake, OMAD (One Meal A Day), Run/Weight Lift and follows a strict diet I am freaking tired of switching between Strava, MyFitnessPal and whatever Apps that I need that only do one specific function.

Yep, I just wanted to everything in one place if that is possible.

Will try to host this on GCP with FireBase using FireStore as well.

The purpose of this porject is to learn IOS development and create an App which can do the above functions I mentioned with the following stages:

Stage 1:

Working App with Inventory tracking - You can list you foods here with its Macros/Nutition values and the package size that you bought it with.

Custom or Automated consumption - Set up to deplete the foods you have listed or automate it as a daily consumption. I personally measure foods to the grams, so I find this helpful.

Reminders on low inventory - Set up custom reminders about the foods that will be running out in x days.

Stage 2:

Display Daily Macros/Caloric Intake - take the consumption of the foods to calculate and display the Macros/caloric intakes. Will work on Micro nutrients later as that is more complicated.

Set up energy consumption - Able to manually input energy consumption and record exercises performed. Will add automated calculations from https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1350959101 later.

Health App Integration/GPS running (optional) - This is to try implement the GPS like tracking like Strava/RunKeeper. Ambitious feature, will consider pushing back until later if difficulty arises.

Stage 3:

Potential features could include and not thoughtout yet:

Barcode scanning, food diversity recommendations, goal weight tracker, Fasting Timer, Personal training bookkeeping...
